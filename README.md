# Nakamura
## lightweight and extensible Discord API wrapper
Nakamura is a structureless*, "cache what you want" library. If you are interested in a version with more utility and features, check out the featured forks section.

* Nakamura doesn't provide classes for different data types (such as users, channels, messages, etc.), instead it let's you handle the data yourself.

### Documentation

Currently, the documentation is not hosted. However, if you want to view it, install dev dependencies and run `npm run doc`, then open `out/index.html`, or spin up a local webserver with `python -m http.server` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/out` (or just start the webserver in the `out/` directory)
